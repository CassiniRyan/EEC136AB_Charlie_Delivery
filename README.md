This repo contain 3 parts, 
Matlab include the ABBIRB 4600 urdf and matlab code for simulation
CCU_STM32H7 directory contain firmware code for center controller unit
Odometry_STM32F103C8 contain firmware code for odemetry 

The two STM32 directory require Keil uVision5 to build and program, it also require ST-Link to program the MCU
notice that matlab code "Final.m" contain address setting, change it to your workspace to run the code.
